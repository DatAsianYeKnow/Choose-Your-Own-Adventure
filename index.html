            <h1 class="menu-text">In the distant future, during the year 2200, deep exploration has significantly evolved! Are you ready to start your journey in exploring mysterious planetary systems?
            </h1>
            <h1 class="text-hide1">Humanity is desperate for resources and habitable space, you're tasked with exploring uncharted planetary systems for suitable planets.</h1>
            <h1 class="text-hide1">The question remains, which solar system shall you choose?</h1>
            <h1 class="text-hide2">I don't care, you don't really have a choice... Anyways humanity is desperate for resources and habitable space, you're tasked with exploring uncharted planetary systems for suitable planets.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="text-hide2">The question remains, which solar system shall you choose?</h1>
            <h1 class="ss">You have the choice between two planetary systems, our Solar System and Alpha Centauri. There are eight planets in our Solar System while Alpha Centauri has two confirmed planets and one unconfirmed orbiting Proxima Centauri. Which one will you choose?
            </h1>
            <h1 class="end-1">You successfully colonized Proxima b! Over time you built a gorgeous green metropolis city with the help of The Deep Exploration company where only the rich could afford to migrate while the lower classes were left on Earth.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="end-me">With the excavation of Helium-3, you contributed to turning Earth into a Type-III civilization. Your contributions made you revered throughout history because you discovered a more efficient fuel source that allowed humanity to explore the galaxy!
            </h1>
            <h1 class="end-pc">You use the submarine that the Deep Exploration company gave you to explore the depths of Proxima c. As your submarine submerges and sinks into the abyss, you feel an uneasy chill on your spine. Your body telling you to turn back while you still have the chance, but something allures you to go deeper... After hours you start to think that this planet is barren of life, but you'd be wrong. Your radar picks up marine life, and eventually, you stumble upon bioluminescent creatures that light up the void. As gorgeous as it may be, you'll soon realize it was a mistake to go this deep as your radar picks up a massive beast that knows you're here.
            </h1>

            <h1 class="end-pc">You hastily record your research and attempt to flee before any harm is done to you, but it's too late. The behemoth heavily damages your submarine but leaves you alone as it couldn't shred through the reinforced contraption. Even though the colossal being left you alone, it had wreaked irreparable damage. The dread starts to suffocate you as you realize you won't make it out of Proxima c. The acknowledgment that your final moments are in this iron cage on another planet makes you despondent. Still, you whistle a spirited tune to alleviate the dire situation after your pensive mood.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="end-pd">You discover that even with the hot temperatures on Proxima d, it's full of lush flora and water full of clarity that extends hectares. There seems to be no sign of intelligent life, but it's brimming with simple fauna and marine life.</h1>
            <h1 class="end-pd">
                Suddenly you hear rustling in the bushes. Your body tenses up as if it could be an apex predator, but to your surprise, it's an adorable critter.
                The creature tilts its head and coos, which melts your heart. It's as if the little fella wants pets and scratches. You try your best to withstand its adorableness, but you're no match and end up taking it along your adventures. Since you are unqualified to identify its gender and it seems to have no indicators of being male or female, you decided to name it Biscuit!</h1>
            <h1 class="end-pd">
                It's highly unprofessional to take an unknown animal with you, but no one is here to witness your lack of concern, so you waltz the landscape until you stumble across ruined landmarks. It seems you've uncovered an ancient civilization. You quickly record your findings and take pictures of the mysterious and eccentric buildings full of puzzling insignia.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="end-pd">
                After your curiosity was satisfied, you took your discoveries and Biscuit back to your hovercraft. You ran tests and analyses on Biscuit to identify what it is, and you found that its roots run in the raccoon and weasel family. You make sure it's safe to bring Biscuit back home with you and boast to your coworkers about the legendary discoveries you found back on Earth.
            </h1>

            <h1 class="dias-1"> You've reached the surface of Mercury and found that it resembles that of Earth's Moon. So you explore the planet and discover that it's full of Helium-3, a form of clean energy you can use to advance technology! Will you set up mines to harvest this groundbreaking discovery?
            </h1>
            <h1 class="diap-1">You land on the surface of Proxima b, the surface seems rocky but could be rich with life and resources. Do you want to colonize this planet?</h1>
            <h1 class="diap-2">Proxima Centauri c is a super-Earth or mini-Neptune about 7 times as massive as Earth. You're unsure if you should explore this planet because of the dangers, but your mother ain't raise no wuss. You're either extremely brave or stupid.</h1>

            <h1 class="diap-3">Proxima Centauri d orbits in the habitable zone, enticing you to survey the mysterious of the exoplanet. It's so close to the sun that it completes an orbit in five days. It also means that its surface is searing, so it is best not to stay there too long.</h1>
